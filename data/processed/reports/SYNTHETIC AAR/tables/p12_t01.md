| The SEEPS (Systems Engineering for Extra Peculiar Safety) reviews and clinical reviews revealed substantial differences between what should have happened under the Nebula Valley Health Trust’s respiratory infection-control pathway and what actually occurred during these unusual episodes. Full patient-location mapping, atmospheric anomaly logs, and bed-movement diagrams have been completed for each synthetic case and are available upon request (some include colour-coded unicorn stickers for clarity). |

| TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGY Cepheid / Core Test The Trust currently uses GeneXpert NebulaPCR X-225 units for rapid testing of four seasonal respiratory viruses. However, testing can only occur:  08:00–20:00 on weekdays  08:00–16:00 on weekends To fill gaps, Ward 47 was supplied with CoreTest® Multi-Virus Combo Panels, capable of detecting Influenza A/B, RSV, and SARS-CosmoV-22. Per SOP, any negative CoreTest requires confirmatory NebulaPCR. This review found:  Two cases where NebulaPCR was not performed before patient transfer |
