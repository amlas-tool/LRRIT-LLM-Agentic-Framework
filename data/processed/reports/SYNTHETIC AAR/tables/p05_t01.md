|  | During this meeting, the first major learning point emerged: Key Issue Identified: Non-adherence to the Trust’s Respiratory Swabbing Megadocument in the Emergency Department. Specifically, ED staff had been:  Using obsolete “Mood-Swabs” that changed colour depending on emotional energy in the room  Forgetting to log samples into the electronic system, instead placing them in a “mystery drawer”  Occasionally confusing flu swabs with novelty glow-sticks left over from the winter party Immediate Actions Taken: 1. Reinforcement of SOP Compliance Senior clinicians reminded all teams—firmly but politely—that swabbing should follow evidence-based procedures, not “whatever feels right in the moment.” 2. Enhanced Surveillance Additional patient tracking and symptom-monitoring processes were put in place, including a temporary ban on the mystery drawer. 3. Commissioning of a SEIPS Review The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety team, led by the Infection Prevention & Perpetual Confusion unit, agreed to conduct a full review of workflow, environment, equipment, and any inexplicable atmospheric events. The findings from this SEIPS review were intended to guide a comprehensive action plan to prevent future occurrences of synchronised respiratory outbreaks, glow-stick-related testing errors, or unexpected alpaca participation.
