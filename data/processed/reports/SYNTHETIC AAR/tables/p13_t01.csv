"The SEEPS (Systems Engineering for Extra Peculiar Safety) reviews and clinical reviews revealed substantial differences between what should have happened under the Nebula Valley Health Trust’s respiratory infection-control pathway and what actually occurred during these unusual episodes. Full patient-location mapping, atmospheric anomaly logs, and bed-movement diagrams have been completed for each synthetic case and are available upon request (some include colour-coded unicorn stickers for clarity)."
"TASKS Winter care pathways are complex, multi-team, multi-pressure systems, requiring rapid escalation, communication, and flow management. The Command Centre Orb provides oversight across the Trust’s risk systems but cannot compensate for environmental and technological limitations. PERSON Although not the focus of analysis, winter pressures placed significant strain on:  Emergency Nebula Department (END)  Acute admitting wards  Staff managing competing priorities and fluctuating patient acuity This environmental pressure contributed to system gaps, but the review remains focused on system, not individual performance. CONCLUSION"
