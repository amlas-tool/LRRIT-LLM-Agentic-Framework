| The SEEPS (Systems Engineering for Extra Peculiar Safety) reviews and clinical reviews revealed substantial differences between what should have happened under the Nebula Valley Health Trust’s respiratory infection-control pathway and what actually occurred during these unusual episodes. Full patient-location mapping, atmospheric anomaly logs, and bed-movement diagrams have been completed for each synthetic case and are available upon request (some include colour-coded unicorn stickers for clarity). |

| Patient 1 (PX) – StarReport 9921  Admission Date: 04/05/2027  Positive Swab Date: 16/06/2027  Patient became unwell while resting in Bay Delta-Three, Bed 2, and was moved to the Atmospheric High Dependency Sphere (AHDS) for ventilation support.  There was a significant delay in moving the patient to an isolation pod, because all three single pods were occupied by patients with unrelated, but equally confusing, infections—including one patient diagnosed with “Mystery Cough Variant #12.”  The positive result was auto-uploaded to the Infection Prevention Constellation Server at 12:04, prompting an IPC practitioner to teleport (walk briskly) to Ward 47.  The patient was transferred to a double isolation habitat at 19:21, with the second bed sealed behind bright orange “Do Not Enter: Strange Virus” tape.  Due to fluctuating oxygen needs and the room’s temperamental air-circulator, an extra nurse was assigned exclusively to the patient.  On the next day (17/06/2027), the blocked bed was used for another patient who also tested positive for Influenza Q, a strain invented solely for this synthetic scenario.  Outcome: The patient sadly passed away on 20/06/2027. Cause of death listed as: o 1a: Respiratory Nebula Collapse o 1b: Influenza Q o 2: Complicating Pneumonic Stardust Clinical Review Highlights (Completed by Dr. Ophelia Starwind, 10/10/2027)  The patient had shown signs of improvement after a prolonged stay and was beginning discharge planning before sudden deterioration.  Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) was initiated in the AHDS bay.  Ward doctor documented: “There is risk to other patients in this bay due to sneeze-radius uncertainties. Attempting urgent transfer to a single pod, but cannot delay NebuloPAP initiation.” |
