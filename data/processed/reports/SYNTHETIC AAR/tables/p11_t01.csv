"The SEEPS (Systems Engineering for Extra Peculiar Safety) reviews and clinical reviews revealed substantial differences between what should have happened under the Nebula Valley Health Trust’s respiratory infection-control pathway and what actually occurred during these unusual episodes. Full patient-location mapping, atmospheric anomaly logs, and bed-movement diagrams have been completed for each synthetic case and are available upon request (some include colour-coded unicorn stickers for clarity)."
"Cleaning Ward 47 has consistently scored 5 Comets (the highest rating) throughout 2027, exceeding the 95% quality threshold. However, the Trust’s decision to remove funding for the Enhanced Cosmic Clean Team (as part of the “Close the Spatial Gap” Programme) has led to:  No additional touch-point cleaning  No support during peak viral season  Reduced attention to frequently touched surfaces such as: o Door plates o Light panels o Holocomm screens o Emergency snack dispensers Desired Outcomes – Internal Environment  Reduce risk of infectious patients being placed in multi-occupancy bays: o Introduce dedicated isolation pod within the AHDS o Increase single-pod capacity before the 2028–2029 “Winter Nebula Surge”  Mitigate ventilation deficits: o Consider mobile air-purification drones or wall-mounted micro-cyclone units o Complete risk assessment and relocation options by September 2028 (possible relocation to Ward Solaris-10 once the Dialysis Robots are moved)  Reduce cross-infection risk: o Reinstate the Enhanced Clean Team for the next winter-pressure season"
