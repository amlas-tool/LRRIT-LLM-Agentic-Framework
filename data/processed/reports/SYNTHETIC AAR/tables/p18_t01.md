| The SEEPS (Systems Engineering for Extra Peculiar Safety) reviews and clinical reviews revealed substantial differences between what should have happened under the Nebula Valley Health Trust’s respiratory infection-control pathway and what actually occurred during these unusual episodes. Full patient-location mapping, atmospheric anomaly logs, and bed-movement diagrams have been completed for each synthetic case and are available upon request (some include colour-coded unicorn stickers for clarity). |

| 1. Mitigating the Risk of Infectious Patients Entering Shared Bays a. Introduce a dedicated isolation pod within the Level-2 Atmospheric High Dependency Sphere (AHDS) for respiratory patients with suspected or confirmed infectious cosmic pathogens. This pod should ideally contain:  Its own air-scrub vortex  A self-cleaning filtration field  A sign clearly stating: “Please Do Not Enter Unless Glowing.” b. Expand single-pod capacity ahead of the 2028–2029 Nebula Winter Surge, ensuring that more patients can be isolated rapidly during seasonal outbreaks of influenza, comet-flu, or other star-borne viruses. c. Revise and re-broadcast the CoreTest NebulaSOP, emphasising that all negative CoreTests MUST be followed by a NebulaPCR before transferring any patient to Ward 47. A failsafe system should be introduced to flag any transfers completed without full virology—ideally via flashing corridor lights or a polite but firm holographic reminder. d. Ensure all nursing staff have functional access to ICE-Star, the Trust’s interstellar results system. Where staff lack logins, the system should gently nudge them with automated messages such as: “Hello, you appear to be working clinically. May I offer you a login?” 2. Mitigating the Lack of Mechanical Ventilation a. Evaluate the use of Air-Purification Drones, Micro-Cyclone Ceiling Units, and Wall-Mounted Ionised Filters in areas where natural ventilation cannot meet safety thresholds. These can be deployed flexibly across bays, pods, or any location where “mysterious breezes” are known to occur. b. Complete a full environmental risk assessment and options appraisal by September 2028, including long-term planning for:  Possible relocation of Ward 47  Conversion of Ward Solaris-10 into a Respiratory Facility once the Renal Dialysis Robots vacate  Installation of vortex-stabilisers to reduce hallway turbulence These actions support both short-term safety and future infrastructure upgrades. |
