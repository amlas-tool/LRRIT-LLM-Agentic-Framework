|  | What Actually Happened On 03 February 2027, a respiratory consultant noticed a cluster of six suspiciously synchronised cases of flu-like illness on Ward 47. These were unusual because:  All six patients developed symptoms within minutes of each other.  One described their symptoms as “feeling like a deflating balloon.”  Another insisted the virus had “strong opinions about jazz.” This led to the submission of six StarChart Incident Reports, each more frantic than the last. Clinical reviews were launched to determine whether patients had genuinely acquired flu or simply suffered from the ward’s famously unpredictable microclimate. While these reviews were ongoing, two additional patients were identified on 09 November 2027 and 21 November 2027 as potentially acquiring a respiratory illness during their stay—both had been housed near the ward’s experimental prototype “fresh-air circulation monolith.” A multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting was urgently scheduled, bringing together representatives from:  The Respiratory team  Emergency Department (ED)  Specialist Medicine leadership  The Infection Prevention & Perpetual Confusion Team  Senior management |  |  |
