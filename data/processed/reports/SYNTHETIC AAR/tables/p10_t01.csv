"INTERNAL ENVIRONMENT Acute Medical Admitting Wards At the start of the period reviewed, Astro Medical Unit 1 (AMU-1) had been closed and temporarily relocated to Ward Nebula-8 due to extensive refurbishment efforts. These building works were intended to create additional single-occupancy stasis pods with built-in gravity-assisted sanitation units. Ward Nebula-8, however, was an old-style Cosmic Nightingale Ward, containing long, open bays and only two non-ventilated single pods, both notoriously drafty due to the corridor’s “permanent breeze anomaly.” Ward 47 Ward 47 is a 28-bed unit consisting of:  Four multipatient bays (including the Atmospheric High Dependency Sphere (AHDS))  Three single “Quiet Pods”  Two double “Duo Pods” None of these facilities contain en-suite sanitation modules, and the AHDS lacks any form of isolation pod for patients with suspected or confirmed infectious illness. According to Intergalactic Health Building Standard 04-01 (2229 Edition), all single and multi-occupancy care pods should have en-suite sanitation, oxygen recycling hatches, and at least optional anti-microbial forcefields. Ward 47 meets none of these standards. Patient Facilities on Ward 47 currently include:  One designated male sonic shower with a gravity-flush toilet  Two designated female sanitation capsules  One shared unisex shower alcove (occasionally occupied by broken air filters “dripping aggressively”) Ventilation Ward 47 relies solely on natural space-breeze ventilation, provided by windows that can be opened manually.",of individuals),
