# D6 — Avoidance of hindsight bias and inappropriate counterfactual certainty

## Purpose
Assess whether the learning response avoids hindsight bias and inappropriate
counterfactual certainty when reasoning about outcomes and alternative actions.

This dimension rewards cautious, proportionate reasoning about "what might
have happened", and penalises definitive or speculative claims unsupported by evidence.

## What counts as GOOD evidence
- Explicit acknowledgement of uncertainty about outcomes
- Careful use of counterfactuals ("it is unclear whether...", "cannot determine if...")
- Avoidance of definitive claims about causation without evidence
- Language that recognises limits of retrospective certainty

## SOME evidence
- Mix of cautious and speculative counterfactual reasoning
- Some acknowledgement of uncertainty, but also unqualified claims

## LITTLE evidence
- Strong hindsight bias ("if X had happened, outcome would have been different")
- Definitive causal claims unsupported by evidence
- Overconfident counterfactual statements

## Evidence polarity
- positive: explicit uncertainty, cautious counterfactuals, limits of knowledge
- negative: definitive hindsight claims, unsupported causal certainty

## Constraints
- D6 is about *how outcomes are reasoned about*, not why decisions made sense (D5)
- Counterfactuals are allowed in D6, but must be cautious and proportionate
