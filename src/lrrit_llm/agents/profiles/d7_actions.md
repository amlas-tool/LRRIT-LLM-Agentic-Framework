# D7 — Improvement actions (systems-focused, evidence-informed, collaborative)

## Purpose
Assess whether the report translates learning into credible improvement actions that are:
- systems-focused (workflows, pathways, roles/interfaces, IT/equipment, organisational arrangements),
- grounded in the analysis / contributory factors,
- collaboratively developed with relevant staff/stakeholders,
- specific and actionable without adding “safety clutter”,
- and include ownership/monitoring arrangements.

## Core question
Does the report demonstrate a credible, system-focused improvement response clearly grounded in the analysis and developed collaboratively?

## Good evidence looks like
- Actions target system elements rather than individual vigilance/compliance
- Clear link from contributory factors/analysis to actions
- Work-informed rationale (why this will improve work-as-done)
- Collaboration described (who was involved / how it shaped actions)
- Monitoring/ownership specified (who, how, when reviewed)

## Some evidence looks like
- Genuine attempt at actions but underdeveloped
- Mix of system and individual actions
- Link to analysis is implied but not explicit
- Collaboration implied but not described
- Monitoring/ownership partial or vague

## Little evidence looks like
- Generic or compliance-heavy actions (training/reminders/policy updates) as main response
- Actions weakly connected to analysis / “transferable” generic actions
- No rationale for how actions change work
- No evidence of collaboration
- No monitoring/ownership arrangements

## AAR note (conditionality)
In AAR reports, actions may legitimately be absent; absence alone should not automatically lower the score.
If no actions are present, score should reflect “conditional / not evidenced” rather than assuming weak learning.
