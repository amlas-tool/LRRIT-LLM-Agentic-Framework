# D8 — Communication quality and usability of the learning response

## Purpose
Assess whether the learning response is communicated clearly and is usable by intended audiences:
- clear structure and narrative (what happened, why, what changes)
- appropriate level of detail (not vague, not overly technical without explanation)
- accessible language (avoids unexplained acronyms/jargon)
- coherence and readability (not internally inconsistent)
- supports learning transfer (key points are clear and actionable)

## GOOD evidence
- Clear, structured sections (e.g., what happened / contributory factors / actions)
- Plain language; jargon explained; terms consistent
- Key learning points are explicit and easy to follow
- Document reads as a coherent account supporting learning transfer

## SOME evidence
- Generally understandable but with issues (vagueness, heavy jargon, poor signposting, inconsistencies)
- Structure present but not consistently applied

## LITTLE evidence
- Hard to follow; poorly structured; unclear terminology; internally inconsistent
- Key learning is difficult to extract

## Evidence polarity
- positive: explicit signposting, clear sectioning, clear learning statements
- negative: vagueness, ambiguity, jargon without explanation, inconsistent or confusing phrasing
