DIMENSION_DEFINITIONS = {
  "D1": "Compassionate engagement with people affected: Compassionate engagement means that affected people’s"
  " needs, experiences, and perspectives were sensitively elicited, understood, and responded to, and that those"
  " conducting the engagement had appropriate skills to ensure safe, respectful involvement.",
  "D2": "Systems approach to contributory factors: A systems approach means that the learning response process "
  " used a structured systems perspective or method to identify, analyse, and interpret multiple interacting system"
  " factors that contributed to the incident.",
  "D3": "Human error is treated as an outcome to be explained, not a cause in itself. The report uses system analysis"
  " to explain why people acted as they did and avoids presenting “human error” (or similar terms such as non-compliance"
  " or loss of situational awareness) as the causal explanation for the incident, with this stance reflected in both the analysis and the learning response.",
  "D4": "Blame language avoided: Blame language is avoided when the report uses neutral, descriptive language and "
  "does not attribute fault, culpability, or responsibility for the incident to individuals, teams, departments, "
  "organisations, or systems, either explicitly or by implication.",
  "D5": "Local rationality: Local rationality is considered when the report explores how the situation made sense to "
  "those involved at the time, given what they knew, prioritised, and could do.  Actions are made intelligible in context.",
  "D6": "Avoidance of hindsight bias and counterfactual certainty: Counterfactual reasoning is avoided when the report "
  "focuses on what actually happened (work-as-done) and does not reason from imagined alternatives about what could or should have happened.",
  "D7": "Improvement actions (systems-focused, evidence-informed, collaborative): Safety actions are systems-focused, "
  "evidence-informed, and developed collaboratively with relevant staff and stakeholders, such that they are meaningful"
  " to work-as-done, owned by those involved, and capable of improving how the system functions in practice.",
  "D8": "Communication quality and usability: The report is clearly and accessibly written, with a logical structure, "
  "clear language, and effective use of visuals, such that it is usable by its intended audience.",
